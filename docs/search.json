    "text": "Experience\nMy career is grounded in managing uncertainty across complex environments, drawing on a foundation established as a U.S. Marine Corps officer and refined in fixed-income trading at Goldman Sachs. Following my graduation from Annapolis, I developed a focus on operational resilience that continues to guide my 20-plus years of experience in information, operational, and financial risk. I view risk as a dynamic, quantitative factor rather than a compliance exercise, and I strive to bridge the gap between executive strategy and technical execution. My goal is to develop security strategies that are commercially viable and responsive to evolving market and cyber threats.\nTo support this strategic work, I maintain a practitioner’s approach to technology and quantitative modeling. Using both R, Python, I develop systems designed to anticipate and mitigate potential risks. I apply statistical methods and stochastic equations to model complex scenarios, focusing on identifying the low-probability “tail risks” that standard models may overlook. Ultimately, my focus is on translating this raw data into clear, actionable insights. By leveraging visualization frameworks like R Shiny, Quarto, & Plotly,I build interactive applications that help boards and senior executives make well-informed, data-driven decisions."

    "text": "Article Link on Medium\nIn the high-stakes world of Texas Hold’em, where incomplete information reigns supreme, players are constantly striving to make the most informed decisions possible. While intuition, experience, and psychological reads play crucial roles, the underlying principles of probability and statistical inference offer a rigorous framework for gaining a significant edge. Among these, Bayes’ Theorem stands out as a potent, though often implicitly applied, tool for refining one’s assessment of an opponent’s hand.\nAt its core, Bayes’ Theorem provides a systematic method for updating our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In poker terms, this translates to adjusting the probabilities we assign to an opponent’s range of possible hands as more information becomes available through their actions and the community cards. It moves us beyond mere guesswork to a more mathematically grounded understanding of what our opponent might be holding."

    "text": "The Foundational Concepts of Bayesian Reasoning in Poker\nTo understand how Bayes’ Theorem applies to Texas Hold’em, let’s break down its key components within the context of a poker hand:\nPrior Probability P(H): Your Initial Belief about Opponent’s Hand (H) Before any significant action on a given street (flop, turn, or river), you form an initial assessment of the likelihood that your opponent holds a particular hand or, more commonly, a range of hands. This “prior” belief is shaped by:\nOpponent’s Playing Style: Is this player notoriously tight, loose, aggressive, or passive?\nPosition at the Table: Players in later positions tend to play a broader range of hands.\nPre-flop Action: Did they limp, call, raise, or re-raise? This is often the strongest indicator of their initial hand strength. General Game Flow: Has the table been playing tight or wild? This prior probability is inherently subjective but becomes more accurate with experience and attentive observation. It represents your best guess about your opponent’s “range” — the set of all possible hands they could reasonably hold, each with an assigned probability. 2. Likelihood P(E|H): The Probability of Evidence (E) Given a Specific Hand (H): As the hand progresses, your opponent takes an action (E). This action — a bet, check, raise, or fold — serves as new evidence. The “likelihood” is the probability that your opponent would take that specific action if they were holding a particular hand from their possible range.\nExample: If your opponent has a monster hand (e.g., a set), how likely are they to bet big? If they are bluffing with a weak hand, how likely are they to bet big? These likelihoods are estimated based on your understanding of your opponent’s tendencies and general poker strategy. Crucially, different hands in their range will have different likelihoods of generating the observed action.\n\nPosterior Probability P(H|E): Your Updated Belief about the Hand (H) Given the Evidence (E) This is the ultimate goal of applying Bayes’ Theorem in poker: to update your initial belief (prior) with the new evidence (likelihood) to arrive at a more accurate, refined probability that your opponent holds a particular hand. This “posterior” probability is what informs your subsequent decision-making. It tells you, “Given what I’ve seen, how likely is it that my opponent has this hand?”\n\nThe Mathematical Foundation: Bayes’ Theorem\nThe formula for Bayes’ Theorem is:\nP(H|E) = [ P(E|H) * P(H) ] / P(E)\nWhere:\nP(H|E) is the Posterior Probability: The probability that your opponent has Hand H, given that you’ve observed Evidence E. This is what we want to calculate. P(E|H) is the Likelihood: The probability of observing Evidence E, given that your opponent has Hand H. P(H) is the Prior Probability: The initial probability that your opponent has Hand H, before considering Evidence E. P(E) is the Marginal Probability of Evidence: The overall probability of observing Evidence E, regardless of the specific hand. This term acts as a normalizing factor and can be expanded as the sum of [ P(E|H) * P(H) ] for all possible hands H your opponent could have."

    "section": "A Specific Example: Navigating a River Bet in Texas Hold’em",
    "text": "A Specific Example: Navigating a River Bet in Texas Hold’em\nLet’s walk through a concrete example to illustrate how Bayes’ Theorem can be applied.\nScenario: You’re playing against a somewhat aggressive opponent who likes to bluff but also bets strongly with value hands. You have a marginal hand — say, a pair of tens with no kicker on a board of K-8–2-J-Q. Your opponent, who has been betting aggressively on earlier streets, now makes a pot-sized bet on the river. You suspect you might be behind, but you’re not sure if they’re bluffing or have a monster.\nOur Goal: To calculate the probability that our opponent is bluffing (H1) versus having a strong value hand (H2), given their river bet (E).\nStep 1: Define Our Hypotheses (H) and Evidence (E)\nH1 (Bluff): Opponent is bluffing. H2 (Value): Opponent has a strong value hand (e.g., A-T for a straight, K-K for a set, or Q-Q for two pair). E (Evidence): Opponent makes a pot-sized bet on the river. Step 2: Establish Prior Probabilities P(H)\nBased on your history with this opponent and their overall playing style, you make an initial estimation:\nP(H1) = P(Bluff): You estimate they bluff in this spot about 30% of the time. (Prior that they are bluffing) P(H2) = P(Value): You estimate they have a strong value hand in this spot about 70% of the time. (Prior that they have value) Note: These should ideally sum to 100% for simplicity in this example, assuming these are the only two relevant states. Step 3: Estimate Likelihoods P(E|H)\nNow, consider how likely they are to make a pot-sized river bet given each of our hypotheses:\nP(E|H1) = P(Bet | Bluff): If they are bluffing, how likely are they to make a pot-sized bet? Let’s say you believe they bet pot-sized when bluffing 80% of the time (they want to look strong). P(E|H2) = P(Bet | Value): If they have a strong value hand, how likely are they to make a pot-sized bet? Let’s say you believe they bet pot-sized with a value hand 90% of the time (they want to extract maximum value). Step 4: Calculate the Marginal Probability of Evidence P(E)\nThis is the overall probability that they will make a pot-sized bet, regardless of whether they are bluffing or holding value. We calculate this by weighting the likelihoods by their prior probabilities:\nP(E) = [P(E|H1) * P(H1)] + [P(E|H2) * P(H2)] P(E) = [0.80 * 0.30] + [0.90 * 0.70] P(E) = 0.24 + 0.63 P(E) = 0.87 (So, there’s an 87% overall chance they’ll make a pot-sized bet in this spot, based on your priors and likelihoods).\nStep 5: Apply Bayes’ Theorem to Calculate Posterior Probabilities P(H|E)\nNow we can find our updated probabilities for each hypothesis:\nPosterior Probability of Bluffing (P(H1|E)): P(Bluff | Bet) = [ P(Bet | Bluff) * P(Bluff) ] / P(E) P(Bluff | Bet) = [ 0.80 * 0.30 ] / 0.87 P(Bluff | Bet) = 0.24 / 0.87 P(Bluff | Bet) ≈ 0.276 or 27.6% Posterior Probability of Value (P(H2|E)): P(Value | Bet) = [ P(Bet | Value) * P(Value) ] / P(E) P(Value | Bet) = [ 0.90 * 0.70 ] / 0.87 P(Value | Bet) = 0.63 / 0.87 P(Value | Bet) ≈ 0.724 or 72.4%"

    "text": "Interpretation and Decision:\nBefore the river bet, you thought there was a 30% chance they were bluffing. After observing their pot-sized bet, Bayes’ Theorem shows that the probability of them bluffing has actually decreased slightly to 27.6%. Conversely, the likelihood that they hold a strong value hand has increased from 70% to 72.4%.\nThis specific calculation suggests that, despite their aggressive tendencies, the pot-sized bet on the river is slightly more indicative of a value hand than a bluff in this scenario, given your initial assessments. Based on this updated probability, you might lean towards folding your marginal pair of tens, as the increased likelihood of facing a strong value hand makes a call less profitable."
