## Experience

My career is grounded in managing uncertainty across complex environments, drawing on a foundation established as a U.S. Marine Corps officer and refined in fixed-income trading at Goldman Sachs. Following my graduation from Annapolis, I developed a focus on operational resilience that continues to guide my 20-plus years of experience in information, operational, and financial risk. I view risk as a dynamic, quantitative factor rather than a compliance exercise, and I strive to bridge the gap between executive strategy and technical execution. My goal is to develop security strategies that are commercially viable and responsive to evolving market and cyber threats.

To support this strategic work, I maintain a practitioner’s approach to technology and quantitative modeling. Using both R, Python, I develop systems designed to anticipate and mitigate potential risks. I apply statistical methods and stochastic equations to model complex scenarios, focusing on identifying the low-probability “tail risks” that standard models may overlook. Ultimately, my focus is on translating this raw data into clear, actionable insights. By leveraging visualization frameworks like R Shiny, Quarto, & Plotly,I build interactive applications that help boards and senior executives make well-informed, data-driven decisions.
